<h2>New DynamO site launched</h2> 
<p>
  The DynamO site has been redesigned and separated from
  marcusbannerman.co.uk to make it easier to find all of the information
  relating to DynamO. The launch of the website is to coincide with the
  release of DynamO 1.3.
</p>
<p>
  DynamO now has its own web domains,
  including <a href="http://dynamomd.org">dynamomd.org</a>,
  <a href="http://dynamomd.com">dynamomd.com</a>,
  and <a href="http://dynamomd.co.uk">dynamomd.co.uk</a>.
