<h2>Dynamo 1.6.0 Released</h2>
<p>
  DynamO 1.6.0 has been released. The major change for this release is
  the switch to the CMake build system. This should make compiling on
  other systems significantly simpler. The compilation tutorial has
  been rewritten and now includes instructions for RedHat systems as
  well as Ubuntu.
