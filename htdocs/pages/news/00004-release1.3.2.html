<p>
  Another interim 1.3 version of DynamO is now released. There are no
  major bugs fixed in this release, aside from an almost negligble
  bias in the reported mean free time. 
</p>
<p>
  However, there are some usability fixes for the visualiser and a
  great increase in the quantity of properties reported in the
  simulation output file. In particular, the transport property
  correlators have been completely rewritten.
</p>
<p>
  Please update to either the dynamo-1-3-2 or the master branch in the
  git repository.
