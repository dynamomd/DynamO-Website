<h2>Dynamo 1.3 Released</h2>

<p>The latest stable version of DynamO is now available. Thanks to a
  large increase in the number of people using the code and lots of
  feedback, there have been many stability fixes and general
  improvements to the code base.
</p>
<p>
  The major new features of this release are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    2D systems are now officially supported/maintained in DynamO.
  </li>
  <li>
    Up to 50% faster in polydisperse systems.
  </li>
  <li>
    It is now significantly easier to generate initial configurations
    of dense, complex systems such as polymers.
  </li>
  <li>
    The file format has been cleaned up to remove confusion about the
    dynamics and liouvillean tags (the useless Dynamics wrapper tag
    has been removed, and the Liouvillean tag has been renamed
    Dynamics to make it easier for new users to understand).<br/>
    <b>Configuration files created using version 1.2 will not work
    with version 1.3, you will have to regenerate them.</b>
  </li> 
  <li>
    Updated to boost 1.49.0, (you will need to do a <em>make
    distclean</em> and <em>make</em> for this to take effect).
  </li>
  <li>
    Removed the requirement for the gzip library, and switched to a
    dynamic/shared version of the bzip2 library (fixes build problems
    on Gentoo and Suse).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  According to the git log there have been 15707 lines of code
  inserted and 23107 lines of code deleted, so another big change
  between versions. You can compare the changes on GitHub, but it may
  take some time to display them.

<p>
  This version continues the efforts to shrink and simplify the code
  to make it more accessible to new developers. There are also many
  bug fixes and usability improvements, all supported systems should
  now work out of the box. A full changelog is posted below:
</p>
<h3>Bug fixes/Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>DynamO:</b> Found the neighbourlists were not being correctly
    reinitialised, causing slowdowns and possible hangs in compressing
    systems (huge speed boost in compression).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>DynamO:</b> Multi-core parallel tempering is now actually in
    parallel. Until now the code actually has been executing in
    serial.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>DynamO:</b> Fixed a rare bug in compressing systems, where
    neighbourlists would be incorrectly sized after a compression.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>DynamO:</b> Changed the default settings of the histogram
    reweighting program so that the results are accurate by default!
    Previously, the results coming out of dynahist_rw could be quite
    innaccurate unless "--min-err=1e-16" was set.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>DynamO:</b> The uniform_01 distribution had its own copy of the
    random number generator. It is unlikely that this affected any
    results, but it is not good practice.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>DynamO:</b> The Green-Kubo Mutual diffusion correlator now
    works (instead of just outputting NaN/inf).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Coil:</b> Fix light placement relative to camera.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Coil:</b> Fixed the bilateral blur filter.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Coil:</b> Fixed many bugs which only appear when resizing the
    display.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>New features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Coil:</b> Added a fullscreen mode, toggled with the f key.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Coil:</b> Objects can now be dragged, for example, the lights
    can be repositioned using the mouse.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>DynamO:</b> Packing of systems into systems is now easy to
    perform.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>DynamO:</b> An estimate of the remaining time left for the
    simulation is now outputted on the screen.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>DynamO:</b> Up to 50% faster in polydisperse systems thanks to
    a new cache friendly nblist implementation.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>DynamO:</b> SLLOD dynamics have been removed, they are
    unmaintained and unused. Shearing systems are still available
    through Lees-Edwards boundary conditions, just not in transformed
    co-ordinates.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>DynamO:</b> All particle positions are now shuffled for mixture
    systems in dynamod to enable faster equilibration.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>DynamO:</b> Removed all deprecated Clone functions for copying
    of classes in the code.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>DynamO:</b> Alter the functions in dynamics that add/get/set
    objects and take/return a pointer to return shared_ptr's (search
    for uses of shared_ptr's get() function).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>DynamO:</b> Change the loadClass XML functions to return
    shared_ptr's.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>DynamO:</b> Improved the sizing of systems when dropping random
    polymers (dynamod -m2).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>DynamO:</b> 2D systems are now officially supported/maintained
    in DynamO.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>DynamO/Coil:</b> Remove the requirement to pass the frequency
    to the visualiser, it guesses at one MFT for each particle.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>DynamO/Coil:</b> Visualisation no longer requires an OpenCL
    compatible graphics card! However, you do still need an OpenCL
    library installed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Coil:</b> Moved to a combined deferred/forward rendering
    pipline which greatly improves rendering performance and
    flexibility.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Coil:</b> Added High-Dynamic-Range (HDR) lighting and gamma
    correction.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Coil:</b> With HDR, Bloom effects can now be enabled to
    simulate over-exposure.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Coil:</b> Sphere glyphs used to render particles are
    ray-traced! This allows the rendering of millions of perfectly
    spherical particles.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Coil:</b> Cleaned up the stereo (3D) vision mode, so it's
    possible for 3D TV's to use it as well as red-cyan glasses.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Coil:</b> There is now a separate Volume rendering
    visualisation executable to allow direct visualisation of volume
    data.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Coil:</b> Volume rendering now uses pre-integrated transfer
    functions for greatly improved render quality.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Coil:</b> Added new camera controls for positioning and
    aligning the camera along with a new camera control modes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Coil:</b> Now requires and complies with the OpenGL 3.3 Core
    profile.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Coil:</b> Fixed segfaults occurring when adding a window
    crashes the main render thread.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Coil:</b> Fixed a rare segfault caused by a miscalculation of
    the glade file data size stored in memory.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Coil:</b> The snapshot button now captures using the same file
    counter as the record button.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Coil:</b> Added some sharpen and hi-pass filters to the screen
    space effects.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Coil:</b> Now it is easy to use multiple light sources in the
    render scene.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Magnet:</b> Upgraded all shaders to GLSL 330.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The next version of DynamO will focus on new features, such as
  compression with walls, assymetric particle shapes, and automatic
  continuous to discrete potential mapping.
