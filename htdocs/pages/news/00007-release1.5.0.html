<h2>Dynamo 1.5.0 Released</h2>
<p>
  DynamO 1.5.0 has finally been
  released. A <a href="https://github.com/toastedcrumpets/DynamO/issues?milestone=2&amp;state=closed">range
  of issues</a> have been fixed (thanks to everyone who took the time
  to raise issues).  This version contains many major improvements,
  including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Documentation</b><br/> There is now a complete reference for
    the output plugins and the file format. This covers almost every
    feature of DynamO, but the tutorials are still being written.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Better XML error reports</b><br/> If there are errors in the
    configuration file, you should get a much friendlier message
    pointing out the location in the file where the error occurred.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>More automation/Simpler configuration files</b><br/> Many core
    features/settings required to run a system are now automatically
    set up (e.g. you don't have to specify a neighbourlist, one will
    be automatically set up).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Visualiser improvements</b><br/> The visualiser is now
    capable of rendering bonds, and a range of other standard
    molecular features. Shadows have also been re-enabled following a rewrite.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Better testing frameworks</b><br/> There is a more complete
    testing system which should help prevent regressions in future
    updates.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  There are also a number of other minor bug fixes and
  improvements. <a href="https://github.com/toastedcrumpets/DynamO/compare/dynamo-1-4-0...v1-5-0">The
  full changelog is available here</a>.
