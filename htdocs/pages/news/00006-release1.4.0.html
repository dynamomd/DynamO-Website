<p>
  DynamO 1.4.0 has finally been released. This version contains many
  major improvements, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Automatic full checking of configuration for invalid states on
    load</b><br/> As soon as the simulator has finished loading the
    configuration, it now verifies that no particles are in an invalid
    state before starting the simulation. If any particles are
    "overlapping" or the capture map has become invalid, these errors
    will be reported to the user on load. As these errors are the main
    source of difficulty, these changes should make DynamO much easier
    to use.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Fully stabilised event-detection algorithms</b><br/> In this
    version of DynamO, all interactions have been reimplemented using
    the stable EDPD approach, as detailed in
    <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.6718">this preprint</a>. This
    greatly enhances the stability of the simulator and even allows it
    to recover from some types of poorly initialised systems.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Ubuntu Packages</b><br/> Users using a recent ubuntu version
    (12.04+) will no-longer have to compile their own copy of DynamO,
    as prebuilt packages are now available at the following PPA:
    <?php button("DynamO Stable
    PPA","https://code.launchpad.net/~dynamomd/+archive/stable");?>
    More information on these packages (and how to use them) is
    available in the <a href="/index.php/download">download section of
    the site</a>.
  <li>
    <b>New Features</b><br/> A few new interactions, such as
    assymetric particle shapes, full wall support including
    compression and polydisperse particles, and constraint forces in
    gravity have been implemented.
    The <a href="/index.php/features">features gallery</a> has been
    updated with some example simulations using these features.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Changed File Format</b><br/> Unfortunately, the file format has
    had to change to acommodate some new features and so
    configurations made using DynamO v1.3 will not load in
    v1.4. Although this is inconvenient for some users, at the same
    time many cleanups were also implemented to ensure the file format
    was as logical as possible and to maximise the
    flexibility/compatibility of the format so that future upgrades
    will not be so disruptive.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  There are also a number of other minor bug fixes and
  improvements. Some of which are detailed in
  the <a href="https://github.com/toastedcrumpets/DynamO/issues?milestone=1&state=closed">Github
    Issue Tracker</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Over the next month or two there will be a focus on writing up a
  full set of tutorials demonstrating how to use DynamO in a range of
  systems.
