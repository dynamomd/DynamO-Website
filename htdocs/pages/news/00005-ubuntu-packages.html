<p>
  As part of the push to DynamO 1.4.0, a Ubuntu PPA repository has
  been set up which automatically builds DynamO from the latest
  development code every day.
</p>
<p>
  This makes it significantly easier to get started with DynamO, as
  you no longer have to compile the code yourself! To find out more,
  check out the <a href="index.php/download">Downloads section</a> of
  the site, or click the button below.
