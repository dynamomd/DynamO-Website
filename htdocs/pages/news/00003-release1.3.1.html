  A bugfix release of DynamO is occurring as there were some
  non-trivial bugs reported and fixed recently. Please update as soon
  as possible to either the dynamo-1.3.1 or the master branch in the git repository.

    5 (major bug)</a>: Errors in the calculation of Cv and internal
    energy on replica exchanged systems.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/toastedcrumpets/DynamO/issues/5">Issue
    1 (major)</a>: Sheared systems with rectangular simulation
    domains fail to detect all events, leading to overlaps.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/toastedcrumpets/DynamO/issues/8">Issue
    8 (minor)</a>: Rendered glyph sizes are incorrect in polydisperse
