<p>
  A bugfix release of DynamO is needed as there were some fairly major
  bugs reported and fixed recently. Please update as soon as possible
  to either the dynamo-1-3-1 or the master branch in the git
  repository.
</p>
<p>
  The three significant bugs fixed are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/toastedcrumpets/DynamO/issues/5">Issue
    5 (major)</a>: Errors in the calculation of Cv and internal
    energy on replica exchanged systems.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/toastedcrumpets/DynamO/issues/5">Issue
    1 (major)</a>: Sheared systems with rectangular simulation
    domains fail to detect all events, leading to overlaps.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/toastedcrumpets/DynamO/issues/8">Issue
    8 (minor)</a>: Rendered glyph sizes are incorrect in polydisperse
    systems.
  </li>
</ul>
