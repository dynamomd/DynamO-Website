  Although this tutorial looks at a multicomponent square-well fluid,
  it provides you with all of the knowledge you need to study any
  multicomponent system. In the following section, we motivate the
  square-well model and discuss its importance as a simplifed model of
  atomic interactions. The remaining sections describe how to
  implement a simulation of a binary (two-component) mixture of square-well
  particles.
</p>

<h1><a id="aboutsquarewellfluids"></a>About square-well fluids</h1>
<p>
  For the purpose of the tutorial, we'll want to simulate a mixture of
  square-well molecules. A square-well molecule is a particle which
  has a hard-core diameter of $\sigma$ and is surrounded by an
  attractive well with a diameter of $\lambda\,\sigma$ and a depth of
  $\varepsilon$. These variables are illustrated in the diagram below:
</p>
<img src="/images/sw.png" alt="A diagram of a square-well molecule including its parameters" width="650" height="232" style="display:block;margin:0 auto 0 auto;">
<p>
  where $u(r)$ is the interparticle potential (which is the potential
  energy between two particles separated by a distance of $r$).
</p>
<p>
  Square-well molecules are simple models which display the two
  fundamental features of real molecules, a short range repulsion (due
  to overlapping electron clouds) and longer ranged attraction (due to
  van-der-waals/London/dispersion forces). A comparison of the
  square-well model (<span style="font-weight:bold;
  color:#000;">black</span>) and a "realistic" interatomic potential
  (<span style="font-weight:bold; color:#800;">red</span>) is given in
  the figure below:
</p>
<img src="/images/swcomparison.png" alt="A diagram of a square-well molecule including its parameters" width="429" height="215" style="display:block;margin:0 auto 0 auto;">
<p>
  It is clear that the square-well potential is a rough approximation
  of the "realistic" potential, but its dynamics are not immediately
  clear. With the "realistic" potential, it is easy to see how a pair
  of particles might "fall down" the potential and attract or repulse
  each other, but how does this behaviour appear in the square-well
  model?  When two distant square-well particles approach each other
  and reach a separation of $r=\lambda\,\sigma$, they enter the well
  (or "capture" each other) and a momentum impulse increases their
  kinetic energy by $\varepsilon$ (they are attracted to each
  other). If they then approach the inner core and reach a separation
  of $r=\sigma$, they will be unable to pay the infinite energy cost
  to enter the core and will instead elastically bounce off it. Once
  they begin to retreat from each other (either by bouncing off the
  core or by missing it) and reach a separation of
  $r=\lambda\,\sigma$, they must have enough kinetic energy in the
  direction of the well to escape it and pay the energy cost,
  $\varepsilon$, otherwise they will bounce off the inside of the well
  (both are attractive interactions).
</p>
<p>
  If we used more steps to more accurately approximate the "realistic"
  potential, we can quite quickly capture the full behaviour of the
  smooth/"realistic" potential. However, the square-well model is so
  interesting because it is so simple! If we can understand the
  fundamental behaviour of square-well molecules, the fundamental
  behaviour of realistic potentials will also be explained without the
  additional complexity.
</p>

<h1>The whole tutorial in brief</h2>
<p>
  We're going to study a binary mixture of square-well
  molecules. We'll have a larger species, A, and a smaller species,
  B. The mixture we will study has a hard-core diameter ratio of
  $\sigma_A/\sigma_B=10$ and a mass ratio proportional to their
  volumes $m_A/m_B=\sigma_A^3/\sigma_B^3=1000$. Both molecules have
  the same well-width factor $\lambda_A=\lambda_B=1.5$. For
  interactions between species we'll use the additive rule. For
  example, between species A and B the interaction diameter is
  $\sigma_{AB}=\left(\sigma_A+\sigma_B\right)/2$. We'll want to study
  a mixture of $N=4000$ particles over a range of densities and
  concentrations. The dynamod/dynarun commands are
</p>
<?php codeblockstart(); ?>
#Create the monocomponent system
dynamod -m 1 -C 10 -d 0.5 --i1 0 -r 1 -o config.start.xml
#Now edit config.start.xml by hand to convert it into a multicomponent system
#Compress the multicomponent system to a higher density
dynarun config.start.xml --engine=3 --target-pack-frac 0.3 -o config.compressed.xml
#Rescale the velocities to set the current temperature to 1
dynamod config.compressed.xml -r 1 -o config.rescaled.xml
#Add a thermostat
dynamod config.rescaled.xml -T 1.0 -o config.thermostatted.xml
#Equilibrate the system
#Run the simulation
<?php codeblockend("brush: shell;"); ?>
<p>
  We'll now look in detail at these commands, in particular how the
  configuration file was edited by hand into a multicomponent system.
</p>
<h1><a id="settingup"></a>Setting up the configuration file</h1>
<p>
  When you first start using DynamO, it is not really practical to try
  to create a configuration file from scratch. It is much simpler and
  convenient to take an existing configuration, which is close to the
  system you wish to study, and to modify it. Once you are familiar
  with the file format you may then write your own tools to generate
  configuration files in the programming language of your choice (see
  <a href="/index.php/tutorialA">Appendix A</a> for more information
  on this).
</p>
<p>
  We need to see what systems the <b>dynamod</b> command can prepare
  so that we can pick the most convenient starting point for the
  multicomponent square-well system. We again query the available
  options of the <b>dynamod</b> command using the <i>--help</i>
  option:
</p>
<?php codeblockstart(); ?>dynamod --help<?php codeblockend("brush: shell;"); ?>
<p>
  A full listing of the options of the <b>dynamod</b> program is
  outputted, and the start of the list of systems it can create/pack
  should look like the following:
</p>
<?php codeblockstart(); ?>...
Packer options:
  -m [ --pack-mode ] arg Chooses the system to pack (construct)
                         Packer Modes:
                         0:  Monocomponent hard spheres
                         1:  Mono/Multi-component square wells
                         2:  Random walk of an isolated attractive polymer
<?php codeblockend("brush: shell;"); ?>
<p>
  We see that square-well fluids can be made using <b>dynamod</b>'s
  packing mode 1. We can get some more information on this mode using
  the following command:
</p>
<?php codeblockstart(); ?>dynamod -m 1 --help<?php codeblockend("brush: shell;"); ?>
<p>
  And a detailed description of the modes options will be outputted on
  screen:
</p>
<?php codeblockstart(); ?>...
Mode 1: Mono/Multi-component square wells
 Options
  -C [ --NCells ] arg (=7)    Set the default number of lattice unit-cells in each direction.
  -x [ --xcell ] arg          Number of unit-cells in the x dimension.
  -y [ --ycell ] arg          Number of unit-cells in the y dimension.
  -z [ --zcell ] arg          Number of unit-cells in the z dimension.
  --rectangular-box           Set the simulation box to be rectangular so that the x,y,z cells also specify the simulation aspect ratio.
  -d [ --density ] arg (=0.5) System density.
  --i1 arg (=FCC)             Lattice type (0=FCC, 1=BCC, 2=SC)
  --f1 arg (=1.5)             Well width factor (also known as lambda)
  --f2 arg (=1)               Well Depth (negative values create square shoulders)
  --s1 arg (monocomponent)    Instead of f1 and f2, you can specify a multicomponent system using this option. You need to pass the the parameters for each species as follows --s1 "diameter(d),lambda(l),mass(m),welldepth(e),molefrac(x):d,l,m,e,x[:...]"
...<?php codeblockend("brush: shell;"); ?>
<p>
  This mode can create a multicomponent system for us using the first
  string option (<i>--s1</i>), but we'll create it by hand from the
  monocomponent system.
</p>
<p>
  Lets start by making a monocomponent mixture of square-wells using
  the following command:
</p>
<?php codeblockstart(); ?>dynamod -m 1 -C 10 -d 0.5 --i1 0 -r 1 -o config.start.xml<?php codeblockend("brush: shell;"); ?>
<p style="font-family:monospaced;">
  The options passed here
  are <a href="/index.php/tutorial2#initial-positions-and-crystals">discussed
  in detail in tutorial 2</a>. The only differences are that the
  number of particles has been increased to 4000 (<i>-C 10</i>), and
  we're creating square-well molecules (<i>-m 1</i>) instead of hard
  spheres. An example of the configuration file is available below (it
  is a large XML file, so your browser may take some time to display
  it).
</p>
<?php button("Example monocomponent configuration","/pages/config.tut4.mono.xml");?>
<p>
  This system has the 4000 particles we're looking for, but we'll need
  to convert a fraction of these to another species to make the
  multicomponent square-well system we wish to study. In the following
  sections we look at what needs to be done to perform this
  conversion, and learn how DynamO handles multiple interactions.
</p>
<h2>Adding a new Species</h2>
<p>
  If you open the <i>config.start.xml</i> file in a text editor,
  you'll notice that there is only one <b>Species</b> defined:
</p>
<?php xmlXPathFile("pages/config.tut4.mono.xml", "/DynamOconfig/Simulation/Genus"); ?>
<p>
  If we want to study a binary system, we'll need to define two
  <b>Species</b> to be able to identify the two types of particles in the
  output. Using two <b>Species</b> also provides a convenient way to specify
  the different masses of the two types of particles. Lets assume we
  want to convert the first 100 particles in the configuration file to
  <b>Species</b> "A" and have the rest as <b>Species</b> "B", we can change the file
  to:
</p>
<?php xmlXPathFile("pages/config.tut4.binary.xml", "/DynamOconfig/Simulation/Genus"); ?>
<p>
  You should notice that we've reduced the mass of the smaller
  particles (type B) to match the ratio $m_A/m_B=1000$. This implies
  that we'll also need to effectively shrink the diameter of the
  particles which are becoming <b>Species</b> B. Instead, we could have
  increased the mass of the larger particles (type A) to satisfy this
  ratio; but this would have meant that we would also have to increase
  their diameter. The problem with increasing diameters of particles
  by hand is that you may accidentally cause nearby particles to
  overlap. We must be careful to avoid creating overlapping cores, as
  the dynamics are undefined in these cases. Although DynamO is
  extremely stable and may eventually resolve these overlaps, it is
  not guaranteed in all cases. We always try to keep one mass scale
  and one length scale set at unity, as this corresponds to a set of
  reduced units (see
  the <a href="/index.php/FAQ#q-what-units-does-the-dynamod-command-useproduce">FAQ
  on the units of DynamO</a>)
</p>
<p>
  You should also notice that the <b>IDRange</b>
  of <b>Type</b> <i>"Ranged"</i> is an inclusive range of particle
  ID's. The particle ID's start with zero therefore the
  first <b>Species</b> tag corresponds to the first 100 particles in
  the configuration file.  For more information on the
  <i>"Ranged"</i> <b>IDRange</b> tag, please see the reference:
</p>
<?php button("Reference entry for <i>\"Ranged\"</i> Type <b>IDRange</b>","/index.php/reference#typeranged");?>
<p>
  If we consult
  the <a href="/index.php/reference#species">documentation for the
  <b>Species</b> tag</a>, we see that each particle must belong to exactly
  one <b>Species</b> and each <b>Species</b> must have a
  representative <b>Interaction</b>, who's <i>name</i> is specified by
  the <b>IntName</b> attribute. This <b>Interaction</b> is used to describe
  particles in the <b>Species</b> for visualisation and for calculation of
  properties such as its excluded volume. Here we will need to define
  at least two interactions, called <i>"AAInteraction"</i> and
  <i>"BBInteraction"</i> which describe the two types of particles in
  the system. In the next section we'll take a look at setting up all
  of the <b>Interaction</b>s of the system.
</p>
<h2>Setting up the Interactions</h2>
<p>
  In the original file, only
  one <a href="/index.php/reference#typesquarewell">square-well
  Type <b>Interaction</b></a> is defined:
</p>
<?php xmlXPathFile("pages/config.tut4.mono.xml", "/DynamOconfig/Simulation/Interactions", 4, 2); ?>
<p>
  Here, we will use three separate <b>Interaction</b> tags to input
  the parameters of the three types of interactions between all
  species (A-A, A-B, and B-B). We were very careful to shrink the mass
  of type "B" particles so that, to satisfy the ratio
  $\sigma_A/\sigma_B=10$, the large particles have a diameter of
  $\sigma_A=1$ and the small particles a diameter of
  $\sigma_B=0.1$. An example implementation using these diameters is
  given below:
</p>
<?php xmlXPathFile("pages/config.tut4.binary.xml", "/DynamOconfig/Simulation/Interactions", 4,3); ?>
<p>
  The first <b>Interaction</b> entry handles the interactions between <b>Species</b>
  "A" particles. A
  special <a href="/index.php/reference#typesingle">"Single" type
  IDPairRange</a> is used to convert a single IDRange, which
  identifies all of the type A particles, into a <b>IDPairRange</b>
  describing all pairings of type A particles. This <b>Interaction</b> is
  also used to represent the type A particles, as it has their
  diameter and well width. Therefore, the name attribute of the
  <b>Interaction</b> has been set to <i>"AAInteraction"</i> to
  correspond with the
  <b>Species</b> IntName attribute.
</p>
<?php button("Reference entry for <i>\"Single\"</i> Type <b>IDPairRange</b>","/index.php/reference#typesingle");?>
<p>
  The second <b>Interaction</b> entry corresponds to the inter-<b>Species</b>
  <b>Interaction</b>s between type A and type B particles. Here,
  another type of <b>IDPairRange</b> is used which takes
  two <b>IDRange</b>s and creates a
  <b>IDPairRange</b> which matches all pairings between them. The
  diameter of the <b>Interaction</b> is worked out using the additive
  rule:

  \[\sigma_{AB}=\left(\sigma_A+\sigma_B\right)/2=\left(1+0.1\right)/2=0.55\]

  Technically, the Lambda is also calculated using the additive rule,
  but as both <b>Species</b> have the same Lambda value we have
  $\lambda_{AB}=\lambda_A=\lambda_B=1.5$.
</p>
<?php button("Reference entry for <i>\"Pair\"</i> Type <b>IDPairRange</b>","/index.php/reference#typepair");?>
<p>
  The final <b>Interaction</b> represents the intra-<b>Species</b>
  interactions between the type B particles. Surprisingly, this has
  an <i>"All"</i> type
  <b>IDPairRange</b> tag which maps to all possible pairings of particles in
  the system. This works due to the way that DynamO searches for
  <b>Interaction</b>s. DynamO moves down the list of <b>Interaction</b>s <u>in
  order</u> testing against each <b>Interaction</b> for a match. The first
  match is the one that is returned! So, this last tag actually
  matches all pairs <u>except</u> for those that match above. The only
  pairs which are left are the B-B pairings.
</p>
<p>
  In the third <b>Interaction</b>, we could have also used the
  following <b>IDPairRange</b> instead of the "All" type:
</p>
<?php codeblockstart(); ?>
<IDPairRange Type="Single">
  <IDRange Type="Ranged" Start="100" End="3999"/>
</IDPairRange>
<?php codeblockend("brush: xml;"); ?>
<p>
  A good reason for using the catch-<i>"All"</i> <b>Interaction</b> in
  the end is that in complex systems with
  unusual <b>Interaction</b> <b>IDPairRange</b>s it can be quite hard
  to define which particles are actually left over. Using
  an <i>"All"</i> rule at the end and catching the complex
  interactions first makes it simpler to implement.
</p>
<p>
  Although the example <b>Interaction</b>s listed above are suitable
  for our system, it is obvious there is more than one way to specify
  the
  <b>Interaction</b>s. For example, we could specify the <i>B-B</i>
  Interaction first instead. A general rule for DynamO is that the
  simplest configuration files are the fastest but the way in which
  the <b>Interaction</b>s are specified will usually not make much
  difference to the performance of DynamO, so use whatever is most
  convenient for you.
</p>
<h3>About CaptureMap tags</h3>
<p>
  You should notice that the <b>CaptureMap</b> tag in the original
  mono-component configuration file has been deleted and that the new
  <b>Interaction</b> tags do not contain them. <b>CaptureMap</b>s are
  used by DynamO to track which particles are currently interacting
  with other particles using that
  <b>Interaction</b>. For <a href="/index.php/reference#typesquarewell">SquareWell
  type <b>Interaction</b>s</a>, the capture map records all pairs of
  particles who are inside each others well. This information must be
  saved and loaded with the configuration file as, if a particle is on
  the edge of the well, it is impossible to determine if they are
  captured or not from their position alone.
</p>
<p>
  Whenever we change a configuration file by hand, its very likely
  that we will invalidate any capture maps inside the file. For
  example, here we've split the original <b>Interaction</b> into three
  new ones. We also changed the parameters of some of
  the <b>Interaction</b>s, so particle pairs which were registered as
  captured may now actually lie outside their new well.
</p>
<p>
  The simplest thing to do here is to delete the <b>CaptureMap</b>
  tags. This forces DynamO to rebuild them when it next loads the
  configuration file. You should note that deleting the CaptureMap
  might cause the potential energy of the system to change slightly,
  so it should be avoided if energy conservation is desired.
</p>
<h2>Summary and finished example</h2>
<p>
  The configuration has now been modified to a two-component
  square-well system and an example of the finished
  configuration is available below. 
</p>
<?php button("Example low-density binary configuration","/pages/config.tut4.binary.xml");?>
<p>
  We'll now look at converting this into a high density
  configuration and how to thermostat the temperature.
</p>
<h1><a id="compressing"></a>Compressing the configuration</h1>
<div class="figure" style="clear:right; float:right;width:400px;">
  <?php embedAJAXvideo("tut4_compression", "x62zeoF457w", 400, 225); ?>
  <div class="caption">
    The low-density binary square-well system under compression.<br/>
    <a href="/pages/config.tut4.binary.xml">View configuration file</a>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  To create the binary system we had to shrink one set of particles to
  avoid causing any overlaps or invalid states. Unfortunately, this
  results in a low-density configuration (see right). The low-density
  behaviour of fluids is fairly well-understood (as it approaches an
  ideal gas). Most of the interesting behaviour we wish to explore
  through simulation appears at higher densities, so we need a method
  to generate high-density systems.
</p>
<p>
  To access high density systems while avoiding invalid states, DynamO
  implements the linear compression algorithm first proposed by
  Woodcock[<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1981.tb55667.x">paper</a>],
  but later popularised by Lubachevsky and
  Stillinger[<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01054337">paper</a>]. This
  is a mode of simulation where all particles grow in size over
  time. At the end of the growth run, the dimensions are all rescaled
  so that the particles have the same initial size, but the simulation
  box has shrunk proportionally.
</p>
<p>
  To carry out the compression, use the <i>engine</i> option
  of <b>dynarun</b> to use the compression engine. You also set the
  end point of the compression using either
  the <i>--target-pack-frac</i> or the <i>--target-density</i>
  option. If you don't use these options, the compression will keep
  running and you'll have to manually stop the simulation by pressing
  ctrl-c.
</p>
<?php codeblockstart(); ?>dynarun config.start.xml --engine=3 --target-pack-frac 0.3 -o config.compressed.xml<?php codeblockend("brush: shell;"); ?>
<p>
  Please see <a href="/index.php/FAQ#packingfraction">this FAQ</a> on why we decided to set the packing fraction,
  not the number density of the system.
</p>
<p>
  A video of the compression run is given to the right. The simulation
  ends automatically once the target number density or packing
  fraction is reached which may take some time. If the system appears
  to get "stuck" (the simulation time is not increasing), then it
  might be wise to stop the compression
  run, <a href="#rescaling">rescale the particle velocities</a>, and
  to run a normal simulation for a while to allow the system to relax.
</p>
<p>
  We will now finish setting up the system by looking at how we might
  control the temperature of the system.
</p>
<h1><a id="rescaling"></a>Rescaling velocities to set the temperature</h1>
<p>
  During compression you should be able to observe that the system's
  temperature and internal energy is varying significantly. This is
  due to the change in internal energy due to density changes as well
  as any work performed by the compression process. In repulsive
  systems, this work always causes heating resulting in faster moving
  particles and more events per unit of simulation time. This will
  cause the compression to slow down as the simulation has to process
  more events per unit of expansion. In attractive systems, the system
  may cool or heat on compression, but even cooling is problematic if
  the system becomes glassy or "stuck" due to its reduced kinetic
  energy.
</p>
<p>
  You may consider stopping the compression periodically to scale down
  the temperature to try to accelerate the compression process. You
  can find out how
  to <a href="/index.php/FAQ#stoppausepeek">stop
  any simulation while it is running in this FAQ</a>. In some systems
  a compression will cause the system to cool down. To alter the
  current temperature of a configuration file we can use the following
  dynamod command:
</p>
<?php codeblockstart(); ?>dynamod config.compressed.xml -r 1 -o config.rescaled.xml<?php codeblockend("brush: shell;"); ?>
<p>
  This will rescale the velocities of the particles in the system so
  that the current temperature is 1 (set by the <i>-r</i>
  option). Rescaling the temperature once after compression exactly
  sets the temperature in "hard" systems such as those only
  using <a href="/index.php/reference#typehardsphere">hard-sphere</a>/<a href="/index.php/reference#typeparallelcubes">parallel-cube</a>/<a href="/index.php/reference#typelines">hard-lines</a>
  systems. These systems have the internal energy of an ideal gas,
  therefore the temperature does not change with time (except if it is
  compressed). In systems such as the square-well fluid studied here
  we will need to use a thermostat to control the temperature.
</p>
<h1><a id="thermostat"></a>Adding a thermostat</h1>
<p>
  Temperature is a measure of the kinetic energy of a particle system
  but there are other stores of energy, such as the interaction or
  configurational energy. In square well systems, particles inside
  another particle's well have an additional negative potential energy
  in addition to their kinetic energy. After you have rescaled the
  temperature and begin to simulate the system again, particle pairs
  may move in or out of each others square-well. This motion will
  convert energy between potential and kinetic and the temperature
  will again change. If we want to measure the system at a set
  temperature, we will need to add a thermostat to hold the system at
  the desired temperature.
</p>
<p>
  To add a thermostat, again use the dynamod tool:
</p>
<?php codeblockstart(); ?>dynamod config.rescaled.xml -T 1.0 -o config.thermostatted.xml<?php codeblockend("brush: shell;"); ?>
<p>
  This will add
  an <a href="/index.php/reference#typeandersen">Andersen
  thermostat</a> to the system with a target temperature of 1 (set by
  the <i>-T</i> argument). This thermostat will eventually bring the
  system to the specified temperature, even with changes in the
  configurational energy, by randomly reassigning particle velocities.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Note</b>: If you wish to change the thermostat temperature at a
  later time, you can either use dynamod on the configuration again:
</p>
<?php codeblockstart(); ?>dynamod config.thermostatted.xml -T 4.0 -o config.thermostatted.xml<?php codeblockend("brush: shell;"); ?>
<p>
  Or you can open up the configuration file in a text editor, and edit
  the <a href="/index.php/reference#typeandersen">Andersen type
  System</a> event:
</p>
<?php codeblockstart();?>
<System Type="Andersen" Name="Thermostat" MFT="1.0" Temperature="1.0" SetPoint="0.05" SetFrequency="100">
  <IDRange Type="All"/>
</System>
<?php codeblockend("brush: xml;"); ?>
<p>
  Now that we have set the density of the system and found a way to
  control its temperature, we can create a state point (simulation
  with a set temperature and density) and investigate its properties.
</p>
<h1>Running the simulation</h1>
<p>
  In summary so far, we've created a monocomponent square-well system
  using dynamod, modified it by hand into a two-component system,
  compressed the configuration, and then added a thermostat to control
  the temperature. 
</p>
<h1>Processing the results</h1>
<p>
