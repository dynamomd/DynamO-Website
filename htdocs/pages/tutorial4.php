  <b>This tutorial is currently being written and is incomplete.</b>
</p>
<p>
  This tutorial uses an example study of multicomponent square-well
  particles to introduce several topics:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    How to use the example configurations generated by
    the <b>dynamod</b> command as a basis for more complex systems.
  </li>
  <li>
    How to specify multiple species and complex interactions in the
    configuration file.
  </li>
  <li>
    How to compress a simulation to higher densities.
  </li>
  <li>
    How to process collected data, including transport coefficients,
    in the output file.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Although this tutorial looks at a multicomponent square-well fluid,
  it provides you with all of the knowledge you need to study any
  multicomponent system.

<h1>Setting up the Configuration File</h1>
<p>
  When you first start using DynamO, it is not really practical to try
  to create a configuration file from scratch. It is much simpler and
  more convenient to take an existing configuration which is close to
  the system you wish to study and modify it as needed. Once you are
  familiar with the file format you may then write your own tools to
  generate configuration files in the programming language of your
  choice.
</p>
<p>
  We need to see what systems the <b>dynamod</b> command can prepare
  so that we can pick the most convenient starting point for the
  system. All the DynamO programs have a built in help for their
  options, which we can call up with the <i>--help</i> option.
