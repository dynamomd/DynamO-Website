<h2>Dynamo 1.3 Released</h2> 

<p>The latest stable version of DynamO is now available. Thanks to a
large increase in the number of people using the code, there have been
many stability fixes and general improvements to the code base.</p>
<p>The major new features of this release are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
  2D systems are now officially supported/maintained in DynamO.
</li>
<li>
  Up to 50% faster in polydisperse systems.
</li>
<li>
  It is now significantly easier to generate initial configurations of
  dense, complex systems such as polymers.
</li>
</ul>
<p> According to the git log there have been 13222 lines of code
inserted and 20559 lines of code deleted, so the code is continuing to
shrink as the effort to simplify it and make it more accessible to new
developers continues. A full changelog is posted below:</p>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>DynamO: Found the neighbourlists were not being correctly
reinitialised, causing slowdowns and possible hangs in compressing
systems (huge speed boost in compression).</li>
<li>DynamO: Multi-core parallel tempering is now actually in
parallel. Until now the code actually has been executing in
serial.</li>
<li>DynamO: Fixed a rare bug in compressing systems, where
neighbourlists would be incorrectly sized after a compression.</li>
<li>DynamO: Changed the default settings of the histogram reweighting
program so that the results are accurate by default! Previously, the
results coming out of dynahist_rw could be quite innaccurate unless
"--min-err=1e-16" was set.</li>
<li>DynamO: The uniform_01 distribution had its own copy of the random
number generator. It is unlikely that this affected any results, but
it is not good practice.</li>
<li>DynamO: The Green-Kubo Mutual diffusion correlator now works
(instead of just outputting NaN/inf).</li>
<li>Coil: Fix light placement relative to camera.</li>
<li>Coil: Fixed the bilateral blur filter.</li>
<li>Coil: Fixed many bugs which only appear when resizing the
display.</li>
</ul>
<h3>New features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Coil: Added a fullscreen mode, toggled with the f key.</li>
<li>Coil: Objects can now be dragged, for example, the lights can be repositioned using the mouse.</li>
<li>DynamO: Packing of systems into systems is now easy to perform.</li>
<li>DynamO: An estimate of the remaining time left for the simulation is now outputted on the screen.</li>
<li>DynamO: Up to 50% faster in polydisperse systems thanks to a new cache friendly nblist implementation.</li>
<li>DynamO: SLLOD dynamics have been removed, they are unmaintained and unused. Shearing systems are still available through Lees-Edwards boundary conditions, just not in transformed co-ordinates.</li>
<li>DynamO: All particle positions are now shuffled for mixture systems in dynamod to enable faster equilibration.</li>
<li>DynamO: Removed all deprecated Clone functions for copying of classes in the code.</li>
<li>DynamO: Alter the functions in dynamics that add/get/set objects and take/return a pointer to return shared_ptr's (search for uses of shared_ptr's get() function).</li>
<li>DynamO: Change the loadClass XML functions to return shared_ptr's.</li>
<li>DynamO: Improved the sizing of systems when dropping random polymers (dynamod -m2).</li>
<li>DynamO: 2D systems are now officially supported/maintained in DynamO.</li>
<li>DynamO/Coil: Remove the requirement to pass the frequency to the visualiser, it guesses at one MFT for each particle.</li>
<li>DynamO/Coil: Visualisation no longer requires an OpenCL compatible graphics card! However, you do still need an OpenCL library installed.</li>
<li>Coil: Moved to a combined deferred/forward rendering pipline which greatly improves rendering performance and flexibility.</li>
<li>Coil: Added High-Dynamic-Range (HDR) lighting and gamma correction.</li>
<li>Coil: With HDR, Bloom effects can now be enabled to simulate over-exposure.</li>
<li>Coil: Sphere glyphs used to render particles are ray-traced! This allows the rendering of millions of perfectly spherical particles.</li>
<li>Coil: Cleaned up the stereo (3D) vision mode, so it's possible for 3D TV's to use it as well as red-cyan glasses.</li>
<li>Coil: There is now a separate Volume rendering visualisation executable to allow direct visualisation of volume data.</li>
<li>Coil: Volume rendering now uses pre-integrated transfer functions for greatly improved render quality.</li>
<li>Coil: Added new camera controls for positioning and aligning the camera along with a new camera control modes.</li>
<li>Coil: Now requires and complies with the OpenGL 3.3 Core profile.</li>
<li>Coil: Fixed segfaults occurring when adding a window crashes the main render thread.</li>
<li>Coil: Fixed a rare segfault caused by a miscalculation of the glade file data size stored in memory.</li>
<li>Coil: The snapshot button now captures using the same file counter as the record button.</li>
<li>Coil: Added some sharpen and hi-pass filters to the screen space effects.</li>
<li>Coil: Now it is easy to use multiple light sources in the render scene.</li>
<li>Magnet: Upgraded all shaders to GLSL 330.</li>
</ul>
